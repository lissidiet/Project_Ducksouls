# Troubleshooting

## Failure split

### Sandbox/network path issue

Symptoms:

- PowerShell `Invoke-RestMethod` fails before a useful JSON body appears
- `curl.exe` reports `schannel` credential or certificate errors
- Python HTTPS call times out on read

Action:

1. Keep the same prompt and parameters.
2. Rerun the script with escalated host-network access.
3. Only blame the gateway after the host-network retry also fails.

### Gateway/business error

Symptoms:

- HTTP `400` with JSON error body
- HTTP `401` / `403`
- Response has no `image_generation_call`

Action:

1. Print the error body.
2. Fix the request, not the transport.

### Image rate limit

Symptoms:

- Stream or HTTP error contains `rate_limit_exceeded`
- Error mentions `input-images per min`, `image_generation`, `Limit`, `Used`, or `Please try again in ...`

Action:

1. Keep the original prompt, images, size, model, and action.
2. Do not shorten, rewrite, simplify, or otherwise change the prompt.
3. Retry the same request after the reported delay or exponential backoff interval.

Common example:

- `Invalid size ... below the current minimum pixel budget`
  Action: request a larger size such as `1024x1024` or `1024x1536`.

## Prompting reminders

- For livestream screenshots, specify `vertical`, `mobile screenshot`, `UI overlays`, `chat bubbles`, `gift area`, and `viewer count`.
- For poster-style images, specify `poster`, `hero image`, or `promotional image`.
- If the user wants a screenshot feel, explicitly avoid `poster layout`.
